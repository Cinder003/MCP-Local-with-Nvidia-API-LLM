# MCP-Local-with-Nvidia-API-LLM
FastMCP server for system orchestration: create/read files (TXT, CSV, XLSX, DOCX, JSON), manage folders, run shell commands, launch apps, list processes, and zip folders with safety guards; plus an NVIDIA LLM client that maps natural language to tool calls with resilient fallbacks and parameter extraction and file previews built-in.
